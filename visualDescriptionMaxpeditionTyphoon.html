            The Maxpedition Typhoon is a backpack designed by the American tactical gear company Maxpedition. Overall, it measures 11 inches in length, 6.5 inches in width, and 14 inches in height. It’s main compartment measures 9.5 inches in length, 4 inches in width, and 13.5 inches in height. The particular model being described is primarily made of a stiff, rigid fabric material that has thick, tightly woven threads. The fabric is colored in a muted, khaki green with a slight sheen on its surface. The color of the fabric is contrasted by the colors of various devices affixed around the bag: Various strips of webbing made of a flexible material that has been colored a slate greenish grey and has a slight sheen to it; Various hardware made of a solid material with a pale greenish grey color and a slightly matte surface; Slate green zippers with zipper pulls made of grey fabric cording that has been knotted to form a loop; And thread throughout the bag’s exterior that matches the color of the fabric cording.
  <br>&emsp;The exterior front consists of two zippered pouches: An upper pouch measuring 8.5 inches in length, 4 inches in height, and 2 inches in width; A lower pouch measuring 8.5 inches in length, 8 inches in height, and 2 inches in width. On the upper pouch there is a strip of 2 inch webbing running lengthwise across the middle of the pouch. Running lengthwise across the center on top of this 2 inch webbing is an additional strip of 1 inch webbing. On the lower pouch there are two rows of webbing running lengthwise next to one another in the middle of the pouch: The first upper row is similar to that of the upper pouch; The second row sitting below is a single strip of 1 inch webbing. All the webbing on both pouches have thread sewn through them, dividing the rows into columns and forming multiple channels of loops. There are three strips of 1 inch webbing positioned over the entire exterior front; Two of them are attached on opposite sides at the top side of the backpack and the last one is attached to bottom side of the backpack, forming a Y-shape. A buckle sits at the intersection of the three strips of webbing.
  <br>&emsp;The backpack’s exterior rear consists of a black, rectangular panel made of a mesh like material. Two oblong shapes with tapered bottom ends are positioned lengthwise vertically on opposite sides at the top of the panel. There is a triangular shape filling the bottom of the back panel with rounded corners. All the shapes have been quilted atop the panel by pale grey thread sewn along the edge of the shapes, suggesting that the panel has been padded.
  <br>&emsp;There are two straps attached to the exterior rear of the backpack. Each strap is 2.5 inches in width and runs lengthwise down the height of the backpack, their shape curving outwards towards their respective sides. There is a single 2 inch webbing loop at the center of each strap.  Additionally, there is a 1 inch strip of webbing attached to the middle of the inner side of each strap with a grey buckle made of solid material, connecting the two straps.
  <br>&emsp;The top of the two straps have been attached to opposite sides at the top of the exterior rear with short strips of 2 inch webbing. This webbing has been sewn into the top of the straps with an boxed X-shape stitch pattern along with an additional short strip of 1 inch webbing that has been attached lengthwise horizontally below the 2 inch webbing, equally splitting its width between the 2 inch webbing and the body of the strap.
  <br>&emsp;The bottom of these straps are attached to the bottom of their respective sides with long strips of 1 inch webbing. This webbing has been divided with thread where the it overlaps with the body of the strap it is attached to, creating two loops. The rest of the webbing has been run through a sort of double-ring hardware that has been made out of a solid material, and then attached to the backpack.
  	<br>&emsp;The exterior left consists of four rows of webbing loop channels split into two identical sets with three strips of webbing each. Each set has a 2 inch webbing strip with a 1 inch webbing strip sewn on top, in addition to another neighboring 1 inch webbing strip sitting below. Running through the bottom set of webbing there is a loop made from grey fabric cord that has been knotted at its end, there is a small cylindrical accessory that has been attached to the cord next to the knot.
  <br>&emsp;The exterior right consists of two components: a zippered pouch that sits at the bottom and measuring 3.5 inches in length, 1.5 inches in height, and 4 inches in width; and a long rectangular sheath-like pocket at the top measuring 1.5 inches in length, 1 inch in height, and 5 inches in width. The covering of the sheath pocket is made of 2 inch webbing.
  <br>&emsp;The exterior top has a long strip of 2 inch webbing that spans the length of the exterior top. Each end of the webbing has been sewn into the backpack, leaving the center unbound as if to create a handle. The ends of the Y-shape buckle strap that cover the exterior front are attached to the sides of the exterior top.
  <br>&emsp;The exterior bottom consists of two strips of 1 inch webbing sewn onto opposite sides and spanning the width of the backpack. Each strip is running through an accessory identical to bottoms of the backpack straps.
