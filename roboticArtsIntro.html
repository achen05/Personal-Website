    &emsp;The parallel between systems of networks on the internet with the ways that things interact in reality is really interesting and reminds me of a project called Semilattice by Aosheng Ran, a recent alum from the Interaction Design program at the California College of the Arts. The project is a designed system of information organization that basically attempts to do what the writing is talking about with matrices: challenge conventional hierarchies of information. In the context of both this reading and Ran’s project, I ask: While nonlinear systems of information seem to more closely match with systems of ideas in our reality, should these nonlinear systems be translated into digital interfaces, where information hierarchy and design also matters to our eyes?
	</br>&emsp;The mention to Gibson’s Neuromancer and cyberpunk reminds me of a research project I’m currently doing about recent culture trends in design and consumerism that seemingly romanticize the idea of a technological dystopia. Internet subcultures like everyday carry, or fashion trends like techwear, all of which strike me as paranoid interpretations of transhumanism.
	</br>&emsp;The increasing prevalence of networks like the internet, as well as the innovation and invention of new networks such as the decentralized ones of blockchain or GoTenna make me wonder if the next era of warfare is not biological but technological. I think we’ve already seen more than a handful of technological violence in the past several decades. Or as the data and information that fill these networks become more influential, perhaps the next era of warfare is not technological, but psychological. I’m sure there have been countless events where misinformation and misleading news led to some conflict.
	</br>&emsp;Some questions would be: Are computers considered inanimate? Can they ever be animated the same way living things are? In reference to the passage on binaries, I wonder of there are alternative systems of computing we can potentially use.
	</br>&emsp;I was disinterested in the reading at first because of its narrative-like writing style which by no means is a bad thing, I think I just prefer reading nonfiction that is more straight to the point. The opening passage also just seems to counter the more theoretical writing of the following passages.
	</br>&emsp;Key phrases: networks, matrices, and computation.

  &emsp;I don’t entirely understand the first part about positive and negative electrolytes? What is equilibrium in the context of electricity? There’s a lot of terminology that I know we covered in class but they still don’t entirely make sense to me, which makes this read sort of difficult as it seems to assume I understand many of these terms. The illustrations also don’t clarify much to me, if anything it seemed like they confused me more. While i understand the appeal of hand-drawn diagrams, I sort of wished they were more graphic as the fluidity of the strokes can be unclear at times. I did find that the later parts about resistance and switches to be much more clear than the introduction. Maybe it’s because those things can be physically seen while the movement and currents of electricity can’t and are more abstract. I liked the idea of the potential for poetry in the ways that electricity works but I have yet to really have anything to say as I still don’t entirely understand it.
