    &emsp;The parallel between systems of networks on the internet with the ways that things interact in reality is really interesting and reminds me of a project called Semilattice by Aosheng Ran, a recent alum from the Interaction Design program at the California College of the Arts. The project is a designed system of information organization that basically attempts to do what the writing is talking about with matrices: challenge conventional hierarchies of information. In the context of both this reading and Ran’s project, I ask: While nonlinear systems of information seem to more closely match with systems of ideas in our reality, should these nonlinear systems be translated into digital interfaces, where information hierarchy and design also matters to our eyes?
	</br>&emsp;The mention to Gibson’s Neuromancer and cyberpunk reminds me of a research project I’m currently doing about recent culture trends in design and consumerism that seemingly romanticize the idea of a technological dystopia. Internet subcultures like everyday carry, or fashion trends like techwear, all of which strike me as paranoid interpretations of transhumanism.
	</br>&emsp;The increasing prevalence of networks like the internet, as well as the innovation and invention of new networks such as the decentralized ones of blockchain or GoTenna make me wonder if the next era of warfare is not biological but technological. I think we’ve already seen more than a handful of technological violence in the past several decades. Or as the data and information that fill these networks become more influential, perhaps the next era of warfare is not technological, but psychological. I’m sure there have been countless events where misinformation and misleading news led to some conflict.
	</br>&emsp;A question would be: Are computers considered inanimate? Can they ever be animated the same way living things are?
	</br>&emsp;I was disinterested in the reading at first because of its narrative-like writing style which by no means is a bad thing, I think I just prefer reading nonfiction that is more straight to the point. The opening passage also just seems to counter the more theoretical writing of the following passages.
	</br>&emsp;Key phrases: networks, matrices, and computation.
