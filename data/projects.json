                "type": "text",
                "content": "Gary,<br><br>As per your email earlier today, three days before the summer semester is about to begin and regarding a pre-class assignment to be completed by the first day of class, I’ve decided to respond with this writing. I’ll begin by stating that I, in no uncertain terms, absolutely hate it when instructors assign work to their students over the break. Doing such an abominable thing is a surefire way to make some of their students such as myself seriously consider dropping their class before it even starts.<br><br> Breaks are special periods of time when some lucky students like me are afforded the invaluable privilege of finally indulging in all the unproductive dysfunction that we suppressed for the duration of the previous semester; of allowing ourselves to think and do nothing in particular. This is a sacred interim that I personally like to spend living like the ordinary loser that I’m not allowed to be at any other time. I like to take ten minute self-care walks from my apartment to the nearby Costco food court (the one I’m currently writing from at this very moment) where I like to eat cheap pizza and ice cream then wallow in self hatred the next morning when I notice I’d been gradually gaining weight from doing this so often. I like to go on Grindr with a faceless profile for hours at a time, trying to see if my ex-boyfriend is still on the app because leaving him wasn’t enough to salve the anger I felt towards his betrayal and so I still have a horrible, vengeful bone in me that takes a uniquely cruel pleasure in seeing him on the app and thinking to myself: <I>what could be more pathetic than being active on Grindr?</I> before I realize that the question is spitting back at my face and I delete the app. I like to go on first dates with men who are too old for me because I never have to pay and because they’ll flatter my ego in ways that I know are fake but I’ll suck it all up like fast good and afterwards I could just say “goodbye” and practically disappear. Are you beginning to understand why it is of the utmost importance that these breaks from school remain uninterrupted? Every break for me as a student at ArtCenter is three weeks, give or take a few days, of just wasting away like this because savoring my youth means believing that time comes in an infinite supply. It’s three weeks of having better things to do—I know, but also knowing that I could just just say “no” to all of them and few things are as liberating as the power of refusal.<br><br> So I must express that when I received your email a few hours ago, I wanted to say to you: <I>How dare you disturb this sanctity of mine, </I>because now I won’t be able to stop thinking about what I’ll do for your assignment and how. The mere knowledge of your email will inevitably ruin the last three days of the break—the precious and last three days of my break—by infiltrating its solitude like an infection with an irresistible and unyielding itch.<br><br> I didn’t even try to feign ignorance. I spent the next several hours letting the assignment fester.<br><br> Your email, addressed to the entire class, told us that for our pre-class assignment, we are to “talk back” the way Bell Hooks wanted to in the essay you’d attached alongside your message. <I>Talk back? I could do that. Easy.</I> In fact, my first idea emerged within mere minutes almost reflexively and I knew that you, Gary Kornblau, would be the authority I’d talk back to. I would design a big, giant poster showcasing the contents of your email for everyone to see which I’d then write over with a fat red marker in big, capital letters the words: “DO NOT GIVE ME FUCKING HOMEWORK OVER BREAK.” But when my initial incitement towards your email subsided some ten minutes later, I began worrying that my idea would be too cliche, too on the nose, the embarrassing spectacle of a college student who believes that they’re clever, intelligent, and most importantly, radically <I>different</I> because they decided to do something self-referential, the rite of passage for obnoxious pseudo-intellectuals, first-year philosophy majors, listeners of experimental sound art, or worse: self-aggrandizing political “artists.” I’d be the person that’d make other students roll their eyes because they know it’s all vanity. That’s one of the problems with talking back in the 21st century, an era utterly subsumed in a culture of narcissism  hiding underneath the more virtuous guise of individualism. Is it really any surprise that in a culture which values individual difference and determinacy, people would eventually find ways to manufacture expressions of it? It only seemed a matter of time until expressions of radicality were sucked up by the machinery, adopted not out of necessity or any real desire for genuine change and difference, but out of the superficial pursuit for the kind of distinction that comes from sheer novelty. The consequences of this aestheticization of radicality make it so that the mere performance of radicality is more important than what it promises, if anything. It’s one of the reasons there’s been some preaching around the block that counterculture is dead. Punk has been transmogrified into an ugly aesthetic object that suburban teens buy with the hopes of expressing the rebellious spirit of a movement that died precisely because of its aestheticization, its commodification. Gay men cruising for illicit and anonymous sex has been overshadowed in the mainstream discourse by Pride parades overrun with rainbow sticker flaunting corporations trying to tell all their customers that they, because companies themselves are people surely, are on the right side of history. Talking back has become Talking Back™.<br><br> I also thought about doing something that wasn’t self-referential at all. I thought maybe I’d talk back to the typical villains, I don’t know…like capitalism or neoliberalism or something. That’s what I’m supposed to talk back to right? But things like that are so abstract and so all-encompassing, I barely even know what they mean; and how and I am supposed to talk back to something when I don’t even entirely understand what it is that I’m talking back to? Is that really talking back? I thought that just meant spewing gibberish, so then I thought maybe I’d talk back to something more concrete, maybe something like racism or xenophobia. I haven’t personally faced any of that in Los Angeles but hasn’t there been an alarming rate of violent crimes committed against Asian people in the Bay Area? Maybe I could “talk back” to that. But who, exactly, would I be talking back to? The enactors of such violence? As if they’d listen in the first place. The culture at large? Preaching to the liberal choir surely. The people governing the Bay Area? I don’t even live there anymore. I just read about it on the front-page of reddit or heard about it from my mother who still lives there, so I just end up worrying because what else is there for me to do really when I’m four hundred miles away? Stripped of all the exigencies of these events, of the essential and immediate context that distinguishes talking back from merely talking—to myself, to a notebook, to imaginary interlocutors, to no one. Talking isn’t worthless, it’s just not talking <i>back</I>.<br><br> Talking back would be talking back to someone who would hear me, and I still liked the idea of talking back to you which led me to the brilliant idea that I just wouldn’t do your assignment. I mean throughout all this time, not even for one moment, did I ever actually want to do your assignment and doing nothing would truly be in the spirit of talking back to it; talking back to you. Furthermore, I think the people who are <I>really</I> talking back right now are the ones who aren’t talking at all; the people who don’t have social media or even an internet connection—the real Neo-Luddites; the people who left the urban landscape to form small and exclusive communities in the middle of bumfuck nowhere like the lesbians in the Landdyke movement; the people who are rich enough or defeated enough to simply not care. These people, I believe, are the ones who have found their way to contentment, one of the requirements of which is feeling no real need to interject at all; to talk back. But I figured that if everyone else in the class showed up with work to show, as in materialized forms of talking back, and I just showed up with nothing, it wouldn’t matter whatever intentioned I had for my lack of work, I’d just end up looking like a pretentious idiot trying to justify their slack under the guise of <I>it’s art!</I> Nonetheless, I want you to know that <I>not</I> doing your assignment would be my ideal response but I don’t feel ready to risk making a fool of myself.<br><br> All that being said brings me to this writing, the reason for it. I love writing as a medium: thoughts compressed into a material object that I could just hurl at someone from across the room, the state, the world. It’s not like verbally talking back, there’s no nervous stuttering conditioned from the anxiety of confrontation, no attempted regurgitating of past thoughts that I swear I could recall at any time except during the moments I need them most, no racing to come up with arguments on the fly which I tend to lose, I think because I’ve always been more of a builder or a craftsman—slow and sound. But the thing I <i>really</I> love about writing, the reason it’s so perfect for this assignment, is because I don’t think writing really does much, if it does anything at all. <br><br> If the essence of talking back is a form of attack, the written word is but one of the many weapons held in its seemingly ever-increasing and all-accessible arsenal; occasionally useful or entertaining in the right hands but more often taken and wielded by people who don’t know how to use it effectively, have it pointed at the wrong target, have overestimated its potential for utility, or simply picked it up because it’s more interesting than nothing, or really because it’s a way of making nothing into an activity. Writing is doing nothing, which is precisely what I want to do. <br><br>Aldon"
