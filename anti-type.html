<br><div class="indent"></div>Consumer culture is currently facing a wide variety of dreadful consequences and was founded upon the intertwining of individual identities and material products. It was through the formation of this relationship that advertisers learned to sell commodified versions of any particular facet of culture to people wishing to identify with such. They did this through the formation of brands rooted in the employment of graphic design as a tool to extract and exploit the aesthetics and optics of culture in order to commodify them. In the face of the dire consequences of consumer culture, ethical graphic design must be inherently anti-consumerist and therefore such practices must both detach themselves from marketing purposes and simultaneously resist contributing to the cultural codification of visual culture that advertisers extract from in the creation of brands. Such practices can do this by employing a visual strategy that is in a constant state of resignification, in which visual meaning is constantly scrambled in order to force a state of dissonance and thereby neutralizing any particular visual language from forming.

<br><br><p class="subheader">You Are What You Buy: A Brief History of Brands in Advertising</p>
<br><div class="indent"></div>Consumer society first emerged in the 17th century when a growing middle-class began embracing new ideas about luxury consumption, such as fashion being a factor to consider when purchasing goods rather than necessity. Other luxury goods included sugar, tobacco, tea, and coffee. Throughout the 17th century, aristocratic patterns of consumption and fashion (as well as their changes) would trickle down through the various classes of society. Entrepreneurs such as Josiah Wedgewood would exploit this phenomenon in the pioneering of marketing techniques in order to influence the prevailing tastes of the aristocracy, which in turn led to their goods also eventually being rapidly bought by the middle classes. The importance of fashion in consumption dramatically increased and would sow the foundations for advertisement as a driving force of consumerism by further reifying the notion that an individual’s personal life necessitates some sort of product.
<br><div class="indent"></div>The industrial revolution of 18th century Europe dramatically increased the supply of goods with new mechanical manufacturing processes, which in turn caused surplus supplies of products that far exceeded customer demand for it. Early flickers of advertising practices emerged as a sales strategy to boost demand for unsold goods by appealing to fashion and novelty. Though it wasn’t until the 19th century that the first forms of modern advertising would emerge. In London, Chairman of Pears soap company Thomas J. Barratt would enlist painter Sir John Everett Millais in order to create an advertising campaign for the company’s products using targeted slogans, images, and phrases and specifically without the imagery of the product itself. The campaign's success would demonstrate one of the earliest commercial utilization of a brand not only to sell a particular product but also as the product itself. By the end of the 19th century, products had mostly disappeared from the advertisements that aim to sell them, instead being replaced by the symbolic rhetoric of brands and images.
<br><div class="indent"></div>Following the theories of Sigmund Freud, the 20th century saw the rise of psychology as a tool for advertisers by repositioning the subconscious mind as a terminal for desire rather than its conscious, rational counterpart. The usage of psychological techniques in order to influence the desires of consumers became known as ‘scientific advertising,’ a method of advertisement that was mostly unknown by the public at the time. Following the success of scientific advertising, the industry began adopting a more mechanical method of advertising in which advertisements were engineered according to focus groups and psychological research insights in order to maximize profits at the expense of creativity. In response to the industry’s increasing normative methods of advertising, younger advertisers in the 1960s would begin rebelling against such practices by incorporating the values of youth culture into their own advertising practices and paved the way for a new paradigm of advertising: the status of being cool. Since then, in an era in which an individual’s identity has become conflated with what they consume, the quality of coolness has been the primary driving force of successful advertising. Companies have and continue to  keep watch of existing and upcoming subcultures, appropriating their aesthetics and philosophies through the creation of brands that emulate such subcultures in order to sell products.

<br><br><p class="subheader">The Aesthetics of Contemporary Anti-Consumerism</p>
<br><div class="indent"></div>Alongside the growth of consumer culture, Anti-consumerism attitudes emerged from criticism of consumption, which most notably began with Norwegian-American economist and sociologist, Thornstien Veblen. Veblen, coined the notion of conspicuous consumption, the practice of buying goods of higher quality than practical, in his now well-known book The Theory of the Leisure Class and was a leading intellectual of the Progressive Era, a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the USA spanning from the 1890’s to WW1 which attempted to address the problems caused by industrialization among other objectives. Emerging with the Progressive Era, Veblen’s idea of conspicuous consumption sparked the ideological basis for anti-consumerism,  a sociological ideology that is opposed to consumerism, and concerns with self with the actions of business corporations in pursuit of financial and economic goals, at the cost of public welfare; this includes environmental protection, social stratification, and ethics. Since then, the dramatic rise of consumer culture has led to a variety of critics, who point out how consumerism has a large variety of potential consequences ranging from damaging the environment by contributing to climate change through the excessive;y usage of resources, the reinforcing of social stratification, cultural homogenization, and some theorist even argue as far as moral compromises. As the 20th century advanced, the immensely harmful effects of consumer culture had become increasingly more influential in virtually every industry, and popular culture began to dip its feet in establishing a wider influence of anti-consumerist attitudes. Later in the 21st century, in the face of such consequences, people began purchasing habits based on shared values rather than purely on the product itself.  It became ‘cool’ to be a conscious consumer. Since then, there are many businesses attempting to brand (or rebrand) themselves based on this shift in widespread consumer attitude which meant drawing upon anti-consumerist philosophies to inform their brand strategies.
<br><div class="indent"></div>In 2017, entrepreneurs Tina Sharkey and Ido Leffler launched Brandless: an American e-commerce company that manufactured and sold products under its own label. Their goal: to tackle name brand prices with competing quality, private label products at the fraction of the cost of their name brand counterparts. They did this by borrowing the successful business models of private labels, fixed price outlets, and subscription services. With the launch of Brandless, Skarkey and Leffler were betting on the assumption that their primary audience have become disillusioned with brands, opting instead towards focusing on the quality of the products they are buying and how they are made; stating that they are targeting the  “conscious urban millennial” and shoppers who are “very connected to their values.” Tina Sharkey says “We’re not anti-brand, we’re not not a brand, we're just reimagining what it means to be a brand.” (Sharkey)
Brandless’ strategy was to strip packaged products to their core, removing any traditional branding in what Sharkey refers to as “brand tax.” Leffler says in an interview “Brandless is a brand — it just has a different set of values to a traditional brand. The thing that has [influenced] everything we do is this notion of just what matters. Just what matters on the packaging, just what matters in the product and just what matters in the way that we talk about the product both internally and externally.” (Leffler) This strategy of reduction and simplification has been echoed endlessly by a particular range of modern visual strategies, namely minimalism and functionalism (in design and architecture), which are rooted in similar, if not identical modes of aesthetic construction. For Brandless, this approach is entirely appropriate, since it both figuratively and quite literally removes any trace of traditional branding. By creating a brand that primarily revolves around communicating utilitarian information in order to make decisions easier for potential customers, Brandless was able to move towards a visual identity that is essentially functional rather than fantastical or imaginary.
<br><div class="indent"></div>	Yet, while the intention of brand is admirable, and apart from the sociopolitical intentions of its founders, Brandless remains an interesting spectacle of another, deeper problem with branding: the reification of cultural codes and associations that increase potential to be infinitely extracted, appropriated, and and finally exploited by current and future entities. In the case of Brandless for example, by employing a strategy best categorized as minimalism and functionalism as a aesthetic basis, it further reinforces the association between ethical, conscious consumption and clean, transparent, and simplified aesthetics which can and is emulated and appropriated by businesses that may or may not truly align with such ethical and conscious practices.
<br><div class="indent"></div>	In response to the rising awareness of secretive, unsustainable practices of fast fashion, Everlane, a clothing company that founded itself on ethical, sustainable, and transparent business and manufacturing practices had drawn upon a similar visual strategy as Brandless several years earlier. Alongside publicly disclosing manufacturing information on its website (such as material costs, labor costs, profit margins, etc.), Everlane’s website, packaging, storefronts, and virtually all customer facing operations have maintained a clean, simple visual identity which all together might seem to indicate that Everlane is holding up its promise of a sustainable, transparent fashionable alternative.  However, behind its minimalist, transparent marketing, Everlane doesn't quite hold up to its ethical claims. Its’ claim of ‘radical transparency’ has significant gaps in public information, and in some instances provides no information at all. Such information holes include: evidence proving everlane minimizes textile waste; eliminate hazardous chemicals from production; reduce its carbon and greenhouse gas emissions throughout its supply chain; a complete list of suppliers; worker empowerment initiatives across its production facilities; living wages; a formal animal welfare policy or a source of animal derived materials. Additionally, former and current employees of the company explicitly refute Everlane’s claim, citing racial discrimination and elleged union busting.
<br><div class="indent"></div>	Alongside Brandless, Everlane is part of a widespread trend of businesses, both sustainable and not, that have marketed themselves using visual strategies optically and philosophically akin to minimalism and functionalism, in order to meet a new paradigm of an ecologically conscious, sustainable culture. This is a problematic notion for two reasons: firstly, that it misleads ecologically-conscious consumers from making clear decisions about what they are buying since it now a brand can seem sustainable without actually being so. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, in a culture that positions ecological consciousness as cool, individual quality, businesses branding themselves as sustainable without actually being so leads to widespread habit of consumers buying unsustainable products for the optics of sustainability while simultaneously not only lacking the sustainable practices that mitigate the consequences of consumer culture, but even further make them worse.

<br><br><p class="subheader">Beyond Identity Oppositions</p>
<br><div class="indent"></div>As evidenced by Brandless, it’s not too difficult to see why many brands aiming to target an ecologically conscious audience have turned towards approaches like minimalism and functionalism as visual strategies. Such philosophies emerged during the early 20th century when Modernism was experiencing its peak period, and grew alongside a rising disillusionment with consumer culture, an interest in simplification, and a repositioning of what is important materially and spiritually. Minimalism for instance is rooted in the reduction of something into a purest form, removing it of anything that isn’t directly necessary for something to still exist as itself.
<br><div class="indent"></div>Such notions are based on the presumption that there exists an ideal, universal archetype of something, which follows the Modernist tradition of the 19th century and early 20th century, which believed in the idea of a universal truth and a linear, inevitable trajectory towards achieving it through technology and the sciences. However, later in a post-colonial 20th century after WW1 and WW2, early postmodern ideology would argue that such universality (truth) is impossible. Postmodernists argued and worked upon the basis that because the meaning of reality was based on individual interpretations of it, a universal reality was impossible because language meant different things to different people, and therefore a universal interpretation of reality was impossible.
<br><div class="indent"></div> In the context of visual languages, it means that a truly neutral visual language is impossible because the meaning of any and all language changes depending on its interpreter. Aesthetic philosophies such as minimalism fail to reduce something down to its purest form because such a form doesn’t exist, therefore any attempt to universalize a language using minimalism and other similar approaches also inevitably fails. For entities such as businesses aiming to position themselves in opposition to branding branding (or at least traditional notions of branding) by simplifying, reducing, and universalizing rather than creating fantasies and narratives, such strategies ultimately fail because neutrality implies truth, and of which is impossible, therefore only the optics of neutrality remain which is merely just another type of brand.
<br><div class="indent"></div>One could see a particular dichotomy drawn in brand methodologies. On one hand there are ‘traditional’ brands that appeal to novelty and imagery, and on the other side there are brands that aim to dissociate themselves from novelty and imagery as a type of brand in itself (Brandless). This dichotomy could be simplified into identification vs. counter identification, in which the former represents a normative rule (in this case traditional modes of branding that employ additive methods to the things they brand) and the latter represents its explicit opposition (forms of branding that employ a subtractive method to the things they represent). In either case, both sides take to identification of some sort as counter identification of any sort by nature is implicitly defined and explicitly identified as the opposite of its source. As a result, any attempt to oppose the normative mode of identification consequently becomes its own type of normative identification, even if the material outputs differ in either mode.
<br><div class="indent"></div>This concept remains relatively unexplored in the realm of graphic design, however, it has been more notably (although still relatively new) in queer and feminist theory, fields that are rooted in examining, navigating, challenging, or otherwise researching notions of identity and its implications in reality. In such fields, the dichotomy is evident in normative cultural assimilation (and therefore its notions about gender, sex, and race) and its explicit counter-cultural identification, where identifying with either ultimately becomes its own normative practice.
<br><div class="indent"></div>In the face of this paradox, academics in such fields have recently begun turning their focus towards a concept called disidentification, a particular type of identification or counter identification that identifies with both modes of identification as a method of disassociating from either particular side of the dichotomy. Judith Butler, an American philosopher, gender theorist, and professor at UC Berkeley, describes disidentification as “the experience of misrecognition, this uneasy sense of standing under a sign [as in label, symbol, category, etc.] to which one does and does not belong.” (Butler 219) Butler’s argument relies on the presumption that identity is rooted in the assignment of signifers (symbols, categories, labels, etc.) that have been repeatedly associated with a particular meaning (a notion which is shared and supported by numerous postmodern fields of study such as cognitive science), therefore for Butler, disidentification is a hopeful destabilization of identity signifiers by forcing (perhaps even repeatedly) a resignification of a particular signifer through demonstrating an instance in which such signifer does not entirely match with what it is presumed to represent. Disidentification is a source of resistance against conforming to any particular normative identification.
<br><div class="indent"></div>In understanding the notion of disidentifcation as it applies to queer and feminist theory, one coudl see how it might be applcable to graphic design as well, particularly in the pursuit of a visual strategy that attempts to disassociate itsef from any form of cultural codification. A particularly potent design strategy might involve the usage of random typography generation. For instance, imagine a website in which its information is rendered in a new and unpredictable font every time the website is loaded or reloaded. The implication of such a methodology would cause a forced resignification upon every load of the website, thereby making the website’s visual identity indefinitely unstable, unpredictable, and therefore resistant forming a definite visual identity. Since advertising exploits cultural codes in order to sell products, by resisting cultural codification, such a strategy can be useful in detaching visual communication from advertising.

<br><br><p class="subheader">Conclusion</p>
<br><div class="indent"></div>In a reality facing dire consequences from excessive consumer culture rooted in a dubious relationship between personal identity and material consumption and propelled by the creation of brands, alongside an ever increasingly stronger relationship between graphic design and advertising, there is a desperate need for an alternative mode of graphic design that does not contribute to the progression of consumer culture. Indefinite random typography generation and typesetting is a potent visual strategy of both detaching graphic design from marketing and simultaneously resisting contribution to the seemingly inevitable cultural codification of visual languages that advertisers draw upon to inform their brands and visual identities. Such a visual strategy is able to do this by forcing information to be in a constant state of resignification by scrambling, diluting, and confusing any and all visual meaning and thereby neutralizing it.
