                    Notes is a digital, online repository for well... my notes! I've decided that from this point forward (October 21, 2023 ~2:00 PM) I will no longer be sharing my notes on my Instagram story, which is what I've been doing.
                    <br><br>
                    There are a lot of reasons this occurence. I cannot name them all right now because I'm short on time. But I do know it feels urgent to me, to do this.
                    <br><br>
                    I've been trying to avoid social media for a while now. I figured if there are people truly that interested in what I have to say, then they'd be willing to visit to this micro-site at their own leisure. 
                    While on Instagram, I'm aware a number of friends, acquaintances, colleagues, even former professors had told me they enjoyed reading my notes whenever I shared them on my Story. But on a micro-site like this there are no Likes or Replies or Viewers or whatevers. I will have no idea whether any of those people (or anyone for the matter) will read my notes here unless they tell me. That will be a blessing.
                    <br><br>
                    For now, I will gradually collect past notes that I've shared and document them on this site. Everything from content to formatting is in-progress. I built this micro-site in the rush of about an hour because I have to work on my CD4 midterm. There aren't even proper text indents yet!

                    1. Honesty in writing, or any form of marking for the matter, is an unwavering devotion to individual subjectivity as truth. It begins with clarity in individual vision/perception/perspective/etc. (“I see it this way”) rather than clarity in any objective sense (“I see it the way it is apart from me”). Ideally, honesty materializes as an exclusive language understood only by its own origin/creator/author/etc. Practically, honesty materializes as language that faithfully represents its origin/creator/author/etc. without embodying it, so as to allow outsiders to peep in to varying (small) degrees.
<br><br>2. Precision, in this context, is the measure of how exact some language is to its respective subjectivity, the distance between the two. Language can never be totally exact.

                    It’s really odd to read comments from people on the internet dedicated to literature criticize the contemporary literary culture. The general consensus seems to be that it’s oversaturated with writers who write about nothing or who only know how to write about themselves. It’s like they’re hopeful that there exists something outside of us—something that we can access—that isn’t simply just another extension of ourselves, of our naturally limited consciousness and our even more limited vision. Don’t get me wrong, I think this hope is admirable. I think people are better off believing that something beyond us does exist, the belief being the important part. But no one who genuinely believes this idea ever becomes a critic. That’s the vice I share with the people on these forums, it makes us perpetually miserable.
<br><br>
It’s not sincerity enacted as a response to irony or over-intellectualism or whatever postmodern trick is being blamed by whomever—the cause of the ripple. Such arbitrary binaries. It’s sincerity, just sincerity, that thing which presupposes a self, which is born of at least some degree of egocentricity, and which understands that the only ultimate form of truth is the one we already behold, to both our pleasure and our dismay (depending on who you ask and when you ask). If I’m coming off as snobbish then maybe it’s necessary, since it seems like the only conflict the literary culture (millennials and zoomers on Internet forums) cares to engage with is snobbery anyway. More snobbery: I was under the impression that this subjectivity was obvious by now, since it seems like entire Modern tradition was based on that notion. One would think of it as more of an assumption at this point.
<br><br>
They want to cite Shakespeare. Shakespeare? They say that great literature is supposed to be more than prose. It’s supposed to make us feel things. They should go watch a movie if they want to feel things, they’re made to make us feel things. But then they say that they want to feel profound things. Only banal people want profound things. In any case, I never felt very much whenever I read Shakespeare. But one time I watched Pokémon: Secrets of the Jungle on my iPad in bed, played Lana Del Rey’s Honeymoon afterwards, and I remember asking myself if that’s what ecstasy felt like.

                    Yesterday evening, a friend and I happened to drop into a Sephora store on a whim and I told her how much I loved to look at makeup packaging. All of it is so masturbatory, little gem-like things like fruit candies, clumps of ecstasy, utterly irresistible but also so fleeting, too fleeting really. They’re not like flowers which make up for their transience by just being a fact of Nature, which is, as far as I’m concerned, permanent. It’s why I think makeup packages are often pretty but never really beautiful because to be beautiful, I think, requires a kind of timelessness, a kind of permanence, a glimpse of the universal.
	<br>It’s one of the reasons I fell in love with Times New Roman, or Times for short, which is what I like to call him, the typeface, even when I know it refers to a slightly different version of him. I used to write love letters to Times but I don’t need to anymore, he’s just always there now.
	<br>Beautiful.
	<br>It’s one of the reasons I adore Kiehl’s packaging so much, partially because I recognize Times, but also because it doesn’t care about being pretty. Kiehl’s, it seems, cares about being effortless, by which I mean that it isn’t conscious of its care, or at least it doesn’t want to seem as such. It wants to look like it was typeset in Microsoft Word, printed on a home printer using labels bought from onlinelabels.com and casually but gracefully adhered onto plastic jars and bottles and tubes from Uline. Why? Not only because it knows the moisturizer, the shaving cream, the cleanser, the whatever product inside is what matters, but more importantly because it also knows what is beautiful doesn’t ever need to try. Beautiful things simply are beautiful, and it wants to make us feel like we are too. Images of ordinarily beautiful people whose beauty seems somehow fundamentally tied to their very being, elegant but without fuss, who don’t really need any product at all but who might occasionally and casually dab on some lotion that they got from the drugstore down the street. It’s effortless the same way all true beauty is effortless by constitution because beauty cannot be controlled or commanded it can only emerge; choiceless. Kiehl’s isn’t quite beautiful but it is, however, conscious of how beauty emerges the same way that the innate clarity of honesty naturally knows. Both make space for it to occur, the sensation of beauty.

                    For the record, that is the internet, which is a great record keeper because it is, practically speaking, indifferent towards records.
<br><br>
An outline of my essay that I must put on hold:
<br>- Mastery dies by the hand of Modernity’s frictionlessness, the mechanism that gives way to our individual narcissism by dissolving any and all barriers between us and that which we want to behold. Now, it is about domination, not excellence and neither the power nor beauty summoned by excellence.
<br>- Mastery is command that presupposes, and submits to, an understanding of the subject being commanded, an understanding which is so great that it becomes practically indistinguishable from aptitude.
<br>- Understanding implies a kind of friction necessitated by observance, by the fact that there is an external subject being observed in order to be understood.
<br>- But external subjects are to be eradicated by Modernity’s logic. Modernity aspires towards a reality in which everything is internal, not merely connected but enmeshed. Understanding becomes impossible because there is nothing to be understood. Everything becomes a product of our individual will and vision. There is no exterior.
<br>- Therefore mastery is no longer possible within nor valued by an absolute Modernity.

                    No one wants to be mid now it seems. Looks, brains, brawn of course but also Objects too: cutting-edginess, Progress, extremities of every multiplicity. Even modesty too has turned into Modesty, title-case, and it became that way when modesty’s essential quietude was unpaired with its essential mediocrity. Mediocrity is what people are adverse to; not enough-ness; mid-ness.
<br>I despise mediocrity too. 
<br>I’m beginning to wonder though if mid-ness is the solution I’m too scared to take, the antidote to a culture hellbent on more! more! more! more progress, more innovation, even more lessening! Or will it be, at least, a personal way out? Submission or ignorance or a disobligation? The wallflower-ness of mediocrity, maybe that’s exactly what I need! Maybe that’s exactly what I should aspire to! Not to be great but not bad either, just good enough.

                    I’ve been very stirred up since midnight, reading Rilke’s letters to a young poet who lived some century ago, imagining a repressed gay man, though I don’t know if he was actually gay or not but his prose pings my gaydar—peculiar, brilliant, flamboyantly expressive, poetic nearing flowery. It’s the voice of a quietly chaotic genius of sorts, surprisingly clear but a frazzled one nonetheless, who asks in his correspondence a question that colored my dreams and permeated the air of my morning and which seemed to challenge something integral to everything I’ve done: why do I write? Followed by, is it necessary? Something dreadful in me wants to say “no.”
	<br><br>I remember reading something from Eileen Myles’ Inferno, something about the necessity of a young poet’s life being full of nothing, of wasting away, and studying their very short attention spans. I think I was nineteen when I read that and it still sticks. I’m really a writer born of boredom, one who wants to deny it, and one who’s learned to do so by documenting otherwise which makes all my writing simply proofs of my living, that my life is happening. I don’t think this is necessary, after all, there is only one thing further removed from life happening than an observance of it and it’s a recording of it. But how do I explain that proof of living, of my living specifically, feels somehow incomprehensibly necessary, even if I know it not to be so? How do I stop myself from feeling as if something of my life will die if I do not document it?
	<br><br>I remember [] telling me that so much of what anyone ever does could be understood as an act of preserving something that died precisely as it happened. When he told me that, it felt like he’d stabbed me. I didn’t know what to say.  It seemed so obvious and in some essential way, of a kind of Darwinian instinct. Of course, so much of what anyone does is an act of preservation, or rather, of avoiding death, not just of themselves but of everything. I don’t know whether I can judge if this is a worthwhile pursuit but I can say that this seems sadly doomed. Writing in this sense is too. But what else when a turn to spontaneity, to unobserved-ness seems equally as fatal in its own unique way? I don’t know, but the undeniable sense that this issue sits at the core of all my writing and that it has the potential to simply dismiss it entirely is, in the truest sense, terrifying.

                    I spent the evening at the shop again. At this frequency I might as well start moving in. I’m finished with my comparator mirror for now until I pick it up again next semester when I have time to adjust the design for the binding barrels. Finally, I could focus on making the brick I’ve been meaning to make, the one I found in San Pedro some time ago. I’m taking it apart and putting it back together again, repeatedly. I can’t stop thinking about it, so achingly beautiful that it haunts me.
I’m in San Pedro tonight but I shouldn’t be, in front of the stage that I call a church, the one I imagine Kelsey Lu singing in when she filmed Due West. It’s not of course. I don’t know where she filmed it and I don’t really want to know. I spent the past two years looking for that particular church, in Pasadena’s Memorial Park, the Hollywood Forever, some neighborhood near the Venice canals, a gas station in Arcadia along Huntington Drive, the most enormous shopping mall I’ve ever been to on the way to Long Beach, a stage at Alhambra Park where they play movies on summer nights, and my favorite, at a park I can’t name somewhere in San Pedro, where I am now, somewhere so sacred to me I refuse to acknowledge it with words, such poisonous things.

                    I spent this evening at the shop again, for the third time in a row this week. It was the sixth prototype of my comparator mirror that was done today, the one I’ll hopefully be showing in class when it’s due next week but I think I’ve already failed. I have one more evening at the shop on Friday to meticulously fuse all the parts together, and I mean actually fuse because everything is acrylic and clear and perfect while everything is completely untouched by Weld-On, which eats away at acrylic in order to bond it. Isn’t that interesting? That fusion requires a kind of corrosion first. I have one shot to do it perfectly and I know I won’t because [omitted] and I talked today about using screws. Screws? Yes. Screws with binding barrels. I don’t think I’ve ever felt so stupid. The entire project is ruined now.

<br><br>Caterina Barbieri’s Fantas for Two Organs has been playing since I left the shop; in the car, in the shower, while eating a microwaved burrito, even when the volume is off. I never knew organs sounded so solemn until now. This is appropriate. I do feel like I’m grieving right now, for the $70 I don’t have that I spent on the acrylic and laser cutting and for all the time I spent designing around the idea that I’d be fusing acrylic not fastening it together! I have three other finals I need to be worrying about, but instead I’m worrying that I’ve become like my father who, although I don’t think he’d call himself an artist, is ultimately paralyzed by his uncompromising pursuit of The Beautiful the same way any artist worth being called one is. I used to resent him for that, for seeking beautiful things that he couldn’t have, for making beautiful things at the cost of making things that functioned and now I don’t know if I still do or do not, resent him that is.

<br><br>I want to say there can be no screws. Screws are so ugly, the way they need to make themselves known, the way they show that something can be taken apart. No, it needs to be fused together, bonded so strongly that one can no longer even comprehend of it ever having been two separate pieces. Completely seamless. I know that I’m asking for too much. I don’t think any kind adhesive can achieve that. Neither can heat, not without making that thing thing-less all together.

<br><br>Is it really true that the sentimental ones are the most cruel?

This is one case in which light, which as far as I’m concerned means color, reveals the truth rather than obscures it. Perhaps I’m wrong to think that ecru could ever exceed this.
