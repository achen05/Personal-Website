        <i>Dust Drawings</i> was first conceived as an experimental, interactive background for my personal website that I ultimately decided to leave out. I’ve always noticed I was acutely aware of my relationship with my computers. It wouldn’t be too difficult to argue that I personified them even. It may come as no surprise then when I began to find the idea of creating art with my computer, as opposed to on it, compelling, poetic even. I figured that integrating an interactive simulation that reflected this relationship into my personal website would be an accurate way to communicate my interests. Users would experience literally ‘drawing’ with a computer.</p>
