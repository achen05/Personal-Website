            I’m sitting in the passenger seat of a car driving through San Francisco’s financial district, having just left the Lamy flagship store on Market Street. I’m holding a long, rectangular box in one hand and taking photos of the package in the other. The box is made of a thick paper that’s been colored in a blueish grey and textured with fine lines. It features Lamy’s logo inscribed in silver ink on the bottom of one side and an array of slits all around the box, resembling a car grill and allowing me to peek inside revealing small glints of metal and plastic. The package has an undeniably futuristic appeal and like a monolith it’s cold, structural, yet incredibly alluring. In my hands, the material feels like a crisp dollar bill. It’s beautiful, yet I can’t help but think its ornamental features are unfit for a brand like Lamy, which has made a reputation out of its reductive, functionalist design philosophy. After some effort I’m able to open the box, revealing one end of the Lamy Safari I had bought which was attached to a removable card spanning the length of the box and fit diagonally inside. The card acted as both an easy way to pull out the box’s contents but also as additional structural support for the box. Clever. As a newcomer to Lamy, their packaging was definitely a nice start.

  	</br>&emsp;There are exactly two things I think about when I first hold the Safari pencil in my hand. Firstly, this is a beautiful pencil. I’m absolutely wowed. Secondly, it’s unexpectedly light. So light in fact that at first I almost wanted it to be heavier, given the $20 I had paid for it. It feels moderately solid in my hand, although I can feel the empty space between the shaft inside and and the outer sleeve which somewhat decreases how sturdy it feels in my grip. It’s definitely not a dealbreaker for me, especially given the visual design of the Safari, I found it quite easy to overlook its not so ideal sturdiness.
    <img src="reviewImages/lamySafariMechanicalPencil/lamySafariMechanicalPencil.jpg" alt="" class="collapsibleContentImage">
    </br>&emsp;The Safari’s visual design reminds me of the works of the iconic German industrial designer Dieter Rams as it fully embraces a reductionist design philosophy that runs parallel to the “Less, but better” approach that Rams was famous for. Surprisingly, a quick Google search tells me the Safari was originally designed in 1980 by industrial designer Wolfgang Fabian, many decades after the design paradigm began to shift away from the reductive approach of modernism and into the less serious postmodernism. Combined with the Safari’s relevance today, the fact that the modernist philosophies which inspired the instrument’s design had continued to be not just relevant but even popular for the past century truly proves the Safari’s timelessness. Marco Achenbach, the individual who’s responsible for product management and development for the Safari at Lamy asks “What looks good?, but above all: What improves the product?” For the Safari, the answer is relatively simple when compared to more complex pencils in a similar league such as the hi-tech offerings from Kuru Toga or the heavy and rugged ones from Rotring. The pencil’s most distinctive features are simply its iconic metal wire clip and triangular grip, unibody design, and expanded eraser cap. It’s a simple, no-frills sort of pencil that presents itself and its purpose honestly: to provide an excellent writing/drawing experience. The Safari truly embodies the minimalism that defined the modernist design era, even giving a slight nod at functionalist design philosophy in its lack of ornamentation. I decided to choose the ‘Charcoal’ colored Safari, the only model in the line that has a matte finish rather than the usual glossy one. I’ve found that the more I use it, the more I appreciate the matte finish in particular. Unlike its glossy counterparts, the unassuming nature of the matte color enhances the Safari’s design philosophy and hides scratches more effectively.
  	</br>&emsp;Writing and drawing with the Safari has been nothing short of wonderful. I quickly discovered that its lack of weight actually enhanced my writing/drawing experience rather than hindering it. In addition to the triangular grip, I found that I could comfortably write/draw significantly longer before beginning to feel fatigue compared to the Muji pencil I had previously used. However, it should be noted that the Safari’s triangular grip was designed for users with ‘proper’ pencil grips and so it may be a dealbreaker for some. While drawing, I could feel no movement or shifting in the pencil’s dispenser and my strokes were firm. The Safari manages to get really close to the experience of drawing with a stick of charcoal or a wooden pencil where there’s a solidity that comes from the fact there are no moving parts within. It’s an excellent experience.
  	</br>&emsp;As for features beyond the the writing experience of the Safari, while I was still impressed, a little less so. The wire of the metal clip is very strong and solid and I have no doubt about its durability. However, the clip’s tension is just slightly too high for my tastes. When attached to even a single piece of paper, the clip will quickly leave a mark. The positioning of the clip also is too low for some, as there have been others who have said that the clip hits their hands when rotating their grip. My hands are small enough that I don’t experience this issue but I can imagine that this might be a problem for some with larger hands than mine. As far as I’m aware, the attached eraser seems be exclusive to Lamy for reasons I can only assume are business related which is unfortunate in that it’s more of a hassle to replace but I don’t intend on using it anyway. The eraser cap doubles as the button to dispense lead and has a width that matches the rest of the Safari’s sleeve which is a nice touch as that doesn’t seem to be popular among other pencils where the cap is more narrow. Overall, the features leave some things to be desired, but none of them are dealbreakers for me.
  	</br>&emsp;The Lamy Safari Mechanical Pencil is an excellent product overall. It offers a great writing and drawing experience that can tackle just about any project thrown at it. Additional features beyond writing are functional but not without some quirks that can be problematic depending on the user. Where the Safari shines though is through its visual design. It truly captures the philosophy and spirit of the modernist design era, and it is no surprise that Lamy prides itself on the bestselling Safari line. Perhaps just as unsurprising is its position as one of the most popular writing instruments in the writing and drawing community overall with a devoted cult following. For people like me, who have a deep interest and passion for functionalist, minimalist, or even just modernist design in general and are looking for a beautiful writing instrument that they can use for anything and everything, the Lamy Safari might just be the on the verge of perfection.
